The question is in C programming..Q1) Write a C program (main) that would do 
the following: Read two integers A and B. A can be positive or negative. Then 
the program writes (in 1’s and 0’s) the binary representation of A as stored in 
the computer. B variable dictates the number of bits you would assume that 
value A is stored in. Remember, that we use 2’s complement form to store values 
in computers. 

Examples: A is 13, B is 18. Then it should show 000000000000001101 A is 126, 
B is 10. Then it should show 0001111110 A is -2, B is 18. Then it should show 
111111111111111110 A is -1, B is 12. Then it should show 111111111111

Hint: Use a for loop with B, int to hold A, show bit values which are the 
rightmost B bits of the int that holds A. Note that you need to start writing 
from leftmost bit (B decides how many) to rightmost bit. Need to use a “mask 
bit” and AND (& operation) of that mask and A value.  Make mask =1, then in 
aloop shift it to left B (or B-1) times, to start off. Add another loop (B 
times or mask is not zero) to check each bit value (0 or 1) after ANDing mask 
and A. Each time mask is shifted right.
